  1. What is vector in C++?
   - A vector in C++ is aclass in STL that represents an array.The advantages
   of vextor over normal arrays are.
   - We do not need pass size as an extra parameter when we declare a vector
   Vector support dynamic sizes.We also resize a vector.
   
  2. Allocation, Deallocation and Lifetime
   - allocation:: Every object require storage. You reserve stroge for 
   objects is a process called allocation.
   - deallocation:: When you're done with an objects,you release the objects
   storage in a process called deallocation.
    1. The object's stroge duration begins, and stroge is allocated.
    2. The object's constructor is called.
    3. The object's lifetime begins.
    4. You can use the object in your program.
    5. The object's lifetime ends.
    6. The object's destructor is called.
    7. The object's stroge duration ends, and storage is deallocated.
